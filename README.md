# Result Analysis Software

## Overview
The **Result Analysis Software** is a desktop application developed to streamline semester result analysis at my college. This application automates the extraction of student details from semester certificates and tabulation registers in PDF format, compiles the data into an Excel file, performs result analysis, and generates reports. It is specifically designed to assist college administrators by simplifying the process of generating meaningful insights from student results.

## Features
- **PDF Data Extraction**: Automatically extracts student details (name, enrollment number, subject grades, SGPA, CGPA) from semester certificates or tabulation registers in PDF format.
- **Excel File Generation**: Creates an Excel file with the relevant student details for further analysis.
- **Result Analysis**: Analyzes student performance, including the top 5 students, the number of students who appeared, and the number of students who passed or failed.
- **Graph Generation**: Generates graphical representations, such as:
  - Pass percentage of students (subject-wise)
  - Average percentage of marks
- **Report Writing**: Outputs the result analysis to a Word file with a summary of top-performing students and overall statistics.
- **Completion Notification**: Displays a dialog box indicating the successful completion of the result processing.

## Technology Stack
- **Java**: Core language used for application development.
- **Apache PDFBox**: For extracting data from PDF files.
- **Apache POI**: For creating and manipulating Excel and Word files.
- **Swing/JavaFX**: For the user interface (desktop application).
- **JFreeChart**: For generating graphs and visual reports.
